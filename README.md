# Student Planner

## Proposal

This application is geared towards secondary and post secondary students to organize and plan out their daily schedules.
As a full-time post secondary student, this project is of interest to me because it would be greatly useful to have a
dedicated application that I can use to keep track of everything I need to do each day.

**Functionality:**

- To-do lists for every day of the week
- Old lists automatically cycle out for new ones each day
- Due dates associated with each task
- Reminders for tasks that are due soon
- Automatically clears out tasks that are past their due dates
- Work-list view to see tasks grouped by tag
